                <p>The percolation refers to the passage of a fluid through a more or less permeable environment. The study of this phenomenon gives access to the knowledge of the porosity of the considered environment. We are interested in the minimum porosity (or permeability) rate,
                    necessary for the considered environment to be able to support the percolation: 
                    This is called the critical probability.
                </p>

                
                <p>
                    The critical probability defines the threshold from which a phase transition appears in the considered environment, in other words, from this probability, there is a cluster that links the sides of our environment.
                </p>
                <h1>Model</h1>
                <p>To illustrate this, consider COVID 19.

                    A population will be represented by a matrix and each individual will be assigned a state according to a certain probability p. An individual can have the state 0: vaccinated, cannot transmit the disease if he is in contact with a sick person, the state 1: not vaccinated, can transmit the disease.
                    
                    A sick person, state 2, will be placed in the center of the population and we will study the propagation of the disease. This is a site-based environment (i.e. each node of the graph is represented by the elements of the matrix) and the critical probability p_critical for this kind of environment is, empirically, 0.59.
                </p> 

                <p>Have fun changing the probability and watch the disease spread!</p>
